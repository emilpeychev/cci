# Orbs

Working with Orbs is using automatic presets.

### Core Context for Orbs

```xml
Explanation:
Orbs: Orbs in CircleCI are packages of reusable configuration elements, providing a way to share and reuse common pieces of pipeline logic.

Usage: In the CircleCI configuration, orbs are declared at the top of the file. They encapsulate predefined configurations, commands, and jobs that can be utilized in your pipeline.

Commands: Orbs often include custom commands, which are encapsulated sets of steps. These commands abstract away complex processes, promoting modularization and reuse in your configuration.
